_Edited by:_ **Joseph Hansel**


### About

This is a website that hosts photographs.

>[NOTE]
>This wbsite is not only limited to proffessional photographers.

The users of this website sign up for accounts that enable them to <ins>upload</ins> photographs, <ins>share</ins>, and even <ins>edit</ins> them. 

Having a _comprehensive biography_ section that can be updated, the website enables its users to market themselves.

_Descriptive texts_ that accompany the photographs serve to guide the website user, thus enabling greater understanding of the photographs and their contexts.


### Blurry Sections

_Blurry Sections_ basically refer to the issues that still need to be ironed out as far as this website is concerned.

Although this is the best version of the website so far, some improvements are to be added as work on the website-code progresses;
the next version should contain the following:

-[x] A feature that enables non-photographers to create accounts and purchase photographs from photographers.
-[x] A feature that enables users to follow photographers and obtain _purchase benefits_.

### Snapping into focus

 * HTML
 * CSS
